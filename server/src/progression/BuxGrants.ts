 * game hands over - and that half belongs to the game.
 *
 * An unknown SKU grants nothing and is logged. The webhook still answers 2xx:
 * refusing it would have Bloxity refund a purchase that was genuinely made,
 * and a SKU this build has not heard of is far more likely to be a catalogue
 * that moved ahead of a deploy than an attack.
